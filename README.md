# Karla Murillos's MTM6201 Portfolio

## Project Description
I made this project based on my prototype showed in ** User Experience Design Class ** 
The main purpuse of this website is to have a portfolio where I can show to different companies my skills in desgining and coding websites, based on clients needs and how I can take all those needs to convert them into a website that fits for them and make sure that website includes great quality in design, coding, SEO, and accesibility.

## Chalenges
1. One of the biggest challenges is that I do not have much experience, I practiced a lot with this webiste to make it better. Each time I opend Vs Code I found something to imrpove and even if the prototype was done, I wanted to add some different  animations to be more interactive.
2. Another challenge was using bootstrap. This was the first time that I coded a website with bootstrap. Honestly this was amazing and bootstrap makes the wrok much easier.

## Lessons Learned
1. How to use bootstrap.
2. Add a public library and javascript.
3. How to use the bootstrap grid system.
4. How to make a website responsive using bootstrap.
5. add images in different sizes and resolutions.
